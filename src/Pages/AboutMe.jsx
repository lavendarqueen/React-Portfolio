        I have always had a fascination with computers and they have always been
        a huge part of my family life. My mother was a computer programmer in
        the days before the PC, programming mainframe computers that used punch
        cards for input! My son studied web development in high school and his
        team won tournaments. He has worked in IT for over 10 years and is
        currently a platform engineer. My nephew is the CEO of a web development
        company, having studied web development and business management.

        I took my first computer course consisting of Cobol and RPG2 when I was
        18 years old. Later, I took online courses in html, CSS, JavaScript, and
        Bootstrap and enjoyed practicing what I learned. Having worked as a
        paralegal for a number of years, I decided it was time for a change. I
        wanted to expand my web development skills and put them to good use. I
        enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development course through the University
        of Denver. As a recent graduate, I am ready to continue my journey in
        this very cool and interesting field.
