        I have always been fascinated with computers. Computers are a huge part
        of my family life. My mother was a computer programmer in the days
        before the PC, programming mainframe computers that used punch cards for
        input! My son took web development in high school and his team won
        tournaments. He has worked in IT for over 10 years and is currently a
        systems administrator. My nephew is the CEO of a web development
        company, having studied web development and business management.

        I took my first computer course consisting of Cobol and RPG2 when I was
        18 years old. Later, I took online courses in html, CSS, JavaScript, and
        Bootstrap.

        Having worked as a paralegal for a number of years, I decided it was
        time to change career paths. I wanted to expand my web development
        skills and put them to good use. I enrolled in a Full Stack Web
        Development course through the University of Denver. As a recent
        graduate of the program, I am ready to contine my journey in this very
        cool and interesting field.
